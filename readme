============ BRIEF ===========================================================
cbIRCBot - By ryonagana and ctx
collab: AlessonZaire

a simple python bot you can execute directly using python or compile to exe (windows) and distribute for yor friends
please modify the  config.cfg file to your own configuaration

HOW TO USE:
first you need to have python already installed i think it's secure use 2,4 version, but i'm using 2.7.2

after you installed and setup

LINUX:
python __init__.py


WINDOWS:

Easy Mode:
	install  py2exe library go to win32 folder and execute "create_executable.bat"
	a bunch of letters will appear.. wait  until finish  
	a "dist" folder will be created, then execute __init__.exe  (dont forget to put config.cfg on the dist folder)

Hard Way:
	go to my computer -> properties -> advanced -> Enviroment Variables
	choose PATH  and after last ";" put your python complete path  (e.g: C:\Python21\python.exe)
	go to Run and type "cmd" then 
	go to ircbot directory and type: python __init__.py
	
	

IMPORTANT:

if you want to compile to exe you need to install py2exe-0.6.9-py2.7.exe  --  http://sourceforge.net/projects/py2exe/files/py2exe/0.6.9/py2exe-0.6.9.win32-py2.7.exe/download
then you go to win32 folder and run create_executable.bat

if you compile to .exe  make a copy of config.cfg and paste on the same directory where  the executable then run it


Next Implementation: a dynamic command parser where anyone can add and remove new features of the program
